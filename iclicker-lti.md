# iClicker LTI

iClicker Cloud uses Learning Tools Interoperability \(LTI\) standards to sync scores to the Blackboard Grade Center. This integration is an alternative to the manual export/import process with external CSV files.

As of Spring2018, iClicker Cloud grades sync to a single column in Blackboard. Every time you sync your scores, the column will be updated to reflect the new running total.

NOTE: Individual session scores can be manually exported from iClicker and then uploaded to Blackboard.

## 1. Select your course.

Open your iClicker Cloud app and select your course. Click either the gear icon in the side panel or the **Edit** button on your course dashboard.

## 2. Get the LTI link.

From the **Settings** window, select the **Grade Sync** tab and select "Single-column grade sync." Click **Copy Link** to copy the course-specific link.

NOTE: This link is unique for each iClicker Cloud course. You need to follow these directions precisely for each course you are teaching.
