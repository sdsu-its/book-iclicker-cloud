In the online gradebook, click the **Sync Grades **button to synchronize your iClicker Cloud score totals to your LMS. Students who have used the link will show a green dot in the **Sync Connection** column. Whenever you sync your scores, you also send an email reminder to any student who has not yet used the link you created. You can turn this option off in the **Grade Sync **tab of your **Course Settings**.

TIP: The online Roster export includes the Sync Connection status for your students.

**How Score Totals are Synced**

iClicker Cloud score totals are synced to your LMS as percentages. In the LMS, you define the total points iClicker Cloud is worth for your course. When you sync the iClicker Cloud percent, it is normalized to reflect the percentage of points defined in the LMS.
