# Automatic Grade Sync With LTI \(Recommended\)

iClicker Cloud uses Learning Tools Interoperability \(LTI\) standards to publish scores from students' iClicker Reef accounts to the LMS gradebook with a single click. This integration is an alternative to the manual export/import process with external CSV files.

**Before you can proceed, ensure that your LMS admin has enabled iClicker as an external tool.**

Currently, iClicker Cloud is a single column upload. Every time you sync your scores, the column will be automatically updated to reflect the new total. \(This can only be done with instructor credentials\).

## 1\)

Select your iClicker Cloud course and open the course settings. Click either the gear icon in the side panel or the **Edit** button on your course dashboard.
