# Sync Scores

iClicker Cloud uses Learning Tools Interoperability \(LTI\) standards to sync scores to the Blackboard Grade Center. This integration is an alternative to the manual export/import process with external CSV files.

As of Spring2018, iClicker Cloud grades sync to a single column in Blackboard. Every time you sync your scores, the column will be updated to reflect the new running total.

NOTE: Individual session scores can be manually exported from iClicker and then uploaded to Blackboard.

### 1. 

Select your iClicker Cloud course and open the course settings. Click either the gear icon in the side panel or the **Edit** button on your course dashboard.
