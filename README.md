# iClicker Cloud Faculty Quick Start Guide

In addition to the regular functionality that iClicker 2 offers, iClicker Cloud offers more features such as GPS based attendance, online gradebook access, and cloud storage. This document will guide you through setting up and maintaining an iClicker Cloud course.

You may continue to use your blue handheld remote to drive your presentation and your polling sessions if you have enabled iClicker handhelds in your course. Add your instructor remote ID, an eight-character code located on the back of your blue remote during account creation or by updating your profile on the iClicker Cloud website.

NOTE: Students may use handheld iClickers in your iClicker Cloud course, but they will still need to get a temporary Reef account in order to sync their username \(REDID\) and iClicker ID into your course roster. They can use this website, [https://app.reef-education.com/\#/login](https://app.reef-education.com/#/login), to get a two week trial account. After two weeks, they will be prompted to pay for an activation code. They can ignore that request and continue to use their handhelds.
