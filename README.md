# iClicker Cloud Quick Start Guide

In addition to the regular functionality that iClicker 2 offers, iClicker Cloud offers more features such as GPS based attendance, online gradebook access, and cloud storage. This document will guide you through setting up and maintaining an iClicker Cloud based classroom.

NOTE: Although students may use handheld iClickers in your iClicker Cloud course, they will still need to get a temporary Reef account in order to sync their username and iClicker ID into your course roster. They can use this website, https://app.reef-education.com/\#/login, to get a two week trial account. After two weeks, they will be prompted to pay for an activation code. They can ignore that request and continue to use their handhelds.
