**Note**: Whenever you sync your scores, you also send an email reminder to any student who has not yet used the iClicker Cloud-association link. You can turn this option off in the **LMS Sync** tab of your **Course Settings**.



**Note**: iClicker Cloud score totals are synced to Blackboard as percentages normalized to the points you defined in Blackboard. While points in iClicker Cloud are built up from zero, the scores in Blackboard start at the maximum number of points and are updated every time a sync is performed.
