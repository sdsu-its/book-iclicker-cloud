# Grade Sync to Blackboard

Before syncing grades to your LMS, please make sure that you have already created the iClicker Cloud Association Link in your LMS.

## 1. Launch Gradebook

Click **Launch Gradebook** within your iClicker Cloud course dashboard to open a new browser that takes you directly to your course Gradebook online, or go directly to [instructor.reef-education.com](https://community.macmillan.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Finstructor.reef-education.com%2F%23%2Flogin) and login with your username and password.

## 2. Sync Grades

In the online gradebook, click the **Sync Grades **button to synchronize your iClicker Cloud score totals to your LMS. Students who have used the link will show a green dot in the **Sync Connection** column. Whenever you sync your scores, you also send an email reminder to any student who has not yet used the link you created. You can turn this option off in the **Grade Sync **tab of your **Course Settings**.

TIP: The online Roster export includes the Sync Connection status for your students. If they have not clicked on the LTI link to sync their accounts in your course, they will not appear in the list with an "N"

**How Score Totals are Synced**

iClicker Cloud score totals are synced to your LMS as percentages and as a running total NOT individual sessions. In the Blackboard Grade Center, you define the total points iClicker Cloud is worth for your course.
