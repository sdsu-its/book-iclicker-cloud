You must provide your course name, institution name, discipline, and course start and end dates. If you are sampling iClicker Cloud and your institution is not in the list, you can use “Demo Institution” \(or if you are Canadian, “Demo Institution Canada”\) as your institution.

All other fields are optional, but completing them will make it easier for you and your students to identify your course.
